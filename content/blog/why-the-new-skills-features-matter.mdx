The EffectPatterns CLI includes a dedicated Skills command group (introduced in `v0.3.0`):

- `ep skills list`
- `ep skills preview <category>`
- `ep skills validate`
- `ep skills stats`

At a glance, that looks like a simple convenience feature. In practice, it solves a real operational problem for teams using local skills with coding agents: quality drift, hidden breakage, and unclear coverage.

This post explains what the new Skills features do and why they matter.

## The problem: Skills are code assets, but often unmanaged

Once a team starts using skills heavily, the number of skill files grows fast. People copy, tweak, and version them. Over time:

- naming becomes inconsistent
- required sections go missing
- skill levels are incomplete
- nobody has visibility into coverage by domain

You end up with prompts that still run, but are harder to trust. That creates silent failure modes: the agent follows weak or partial instructions and output quality regresses.

The new Skills commands treat skills like first-class assets, not loose markdown files.

## `ep skills list`: discover what actually exists

`ep skills list` gives you a concrete inventory of discovered skills. Human output shows category and skill levels; JSON output includes full metadata (including file path).

```bash
ep skills list
ep skills list --json
```

Why it matters:

- You get a shared source of truth across contributors.
- New team members can see the actual catalog immediately.
- `--json` output makes it scriptable for internal dashboards or checks.

## `ep skills preview <category>`: inspect one skill end-to-end

`ep skills preview` loads the full `SKILL.md` content for a category.

```bash
ep skills preview testing
ep skills preview testing --json
```

Why it matters:

- You can review exactly what the agent will read before running a workflow.
- Debugging becomes faster: no guessing which file/version is being applied.
- In JSON mode, you can automate audits or diff snapshots.

## `ep skills validate`: enforce structure before quality degrades

`ep skills validate` checks all discovered skills for required structure and content expectations.

Current checks include:

- main heading exists (`# `)
- at least one pattern heading (`###`)
- at least one level mention (`beginner|intermediate|advanced`)
- required sections exist:
  - `Good Example`
  - `Anti-Pattern`
  - `Rationale`

```bash
ep skills validate
ep skills validate --json
```

Behavior that matters for automation:

- exits non-zero when validation errors exist

That single behavior is what turns validation into a CI gate. You can prevent malformed skills from landing in main.

## `ep skills stats`: measure coverage instead of guessing

`ep skills stats` reports aggregate metrics such as:

- total skills
- total patterns referenced
- distribution by skill level
- category coverage

```bash
ep skills stats
ep skills stats --json
```

Why it matters:

- You can spot imbalance (for example, too many beginner skills, weak advanced coverage).
- You can track growth over time with real numbers.
- You can prioritize authoring where gaps are obvious.

## Local-first by design

Skills commands operate on local filesystem content, not remote API lookups.

That is important because skills are typically workspace-scoped operational artifacts. The CLI resolves the skills directory with predictable order:

1. `EP_SKILLS_DIR` (absolute path, or relative to current working directory)
2. auto-discovery from cwd upward for `.claude-plugin/plugins/effect-patterns/skills`
3. fallback to cwd + default path (fails with actionable guidance if missing)

This keeps behavior deterministic in local dev, CI, and multi-repo environments.

## Why this is a real workflow improvement

The new Skills commands close a loop that most teams previously handled manually:

1. Discover skills
2. Inspect content
3. Validate quality rules
4. Measure coverage

Now all four steps are first-class CLI workflows with machine-readable output. That makes skills governance repeatable instead of ad hoc.

For teams running coding agents in production workflows, this is the difference between "we have some prompts" and "we have an enforceable skills system."

## A practical baseline workflow

If you are adopting these commands now, start with this baseline:

```bash
# discover inventory
ep skills list --json

# validate every change
ep skills validate

# review one category deeply
ep skills preview testing

# track coverage over time
ep skills stats --json
```

Then wire `ep skills validate` into CI so broken skills fail fast.

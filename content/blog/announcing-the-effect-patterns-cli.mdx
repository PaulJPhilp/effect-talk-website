The EffectPatterns CLI is now live.

If you use Effect in real projects, you should not have to stop what you are doing, open a browser, and hunt for examples every time you need a pattern. The CLI brings the pattern library directly into your terminal so you can search, inspect, and apply patterns where you already work.

## What ships today

The CLI package is published as `@effect-patterns/ep-cli` and exposes a focused command surface:

- `search`
- `list`
- `show`
- `install add`
- `install list`
- `skills list`
- `skills preview`
- `skills validate`
- `skills stats`
- `login`

This is the stable end-user surface for discovering patterns and installing AI tool rules.

## Install in under a minute

```bash
# Bun (recommended)
bun add -g @effect-patterns/ep-cli

# npm
npm install -g @effect-patterns/ep-cli

# verify
ep --version
```

Once installed, `ep` is available globally in your shell.

## Core command workflow

```bash
# 1) list patterns
ep list

# 2) search by keyword
ep search "retry"

# 3) inspect one pattern in detail
ep show retry-with-backoff

# 4) see install targets
ep install list
```

This is the fastest path from "I need an Effect pattern" to "I have a concrete example in front of me."

## Getting started

Managing API keys by hand is a chore. `ep login` automates it.

Run this first:

```bash
ep login
```

What happens:

1. The CLI opens a browser window for authentication.
2. It starts a local callback server.
3. After login, the callback captures your key.
4. The CLI writes config JSON to `EP_CONFIG_FILE` if set, otherwise `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ep-cli/config.json` (fallback `~/.config/ep-cli/config.json`).

If your API is protected, pattern fetching and AI rule installation require authentication. `ep login` is the direct setup path.

## Pattern discovery from the terminal

The discovery flow is intentionally simple:

1. `ep search "<query>"` to narrow by concept.
2. `ep list` with filters when you want breadth.
3. `ep show <pattern-id>` when you want full detail.

Examples:

```bash
ep search "error handling"
ep list --difficulty beginner --category error-handling
ep show handle-errors-with-catch
```

Use this when you are coding and want to stay in-context, not tab-switching between docs pages.

## Install rules into AI coding tools

The CLI also installs EffectPatterns rule bundles for supported tools.

```bash
# install for Cursor
ep install add --tool cursor

# install for VS Code with filters
ep install add --tool vscode --skill-level intermediate --use-case error-handling

# interactive install for Windsurf
ep install add --tool windsurf -i

# list available install targets
ep install list
```

Supported tool targets include `agent` (alias: `agents`), `claude`, `cursor`, `vscode`, and `windsurf`.

## Skills commands for local validation and inspection

If you work with local skills, the CLI includes dedicated commands:

```bash
ep skills list
ep skills preview error-management
ep skills validate
ep skills stats
```

This keeps your skill workflows and Effect pattern workflows in one place.

## Why this matters in practice

For most teams, Effect adoption slows down at the same point: people know the primitives, but they need concrete production patterns quickly. The CLI reduces that friction:

- You can discover patterns while coding, without leaving the terminal.
- You can inspect exact pattern IDs and examples before applying them.
- You can distribute the same rule sets across editors and agent tools.

It is designed for the moment where you are in a task, blocked on implementation detail, and need an answer now.

## Requirements

- Bun 1.0+ (recommended) or Node.js with npm
- Internet access to the Effect Patterns API

## What is next

This release focuses on stable core workflows: discovery, install, and skills support. Next iterations will continue improving command ergonomics and the surrounding toolchain integrations while keeping the command surface explicit and script-friendly.
